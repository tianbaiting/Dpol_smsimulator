ABSTRACT = {The density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy is among the most uncertain parts of the Equation of State (EOS) of dense neutron-rich nuclear matter. It is currently poorly known especially at suprasaturation densities partially because of our poor knowledge about isovector nuclear interactions at short distances. Because of its broad impacts on many interesting issues, pinning down the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy has been a longstanding and shared goal of both astrophysics and nuclear physics. New observational data of neutron stars including their masses, radii, and tidal deformations since GW170817 have helped improve our knowledge about nuclear symmetry energy, especially at high densities. Based on various model analyses of these new data by many people in the nuclear astrophysics community, while our brief review might be incomplete and biased unintentionally, we learned in particular the following: (1) The slope parameter L of nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density ρ0 of nuclear matter from 24 new analyses of neutron star observables was about L≈57.7±19 MeV at a 68% confidence level, consistent with its fiducial value from surveys of over 50 earlier analyses of both terrestrial and astrophysical data within error bars. (2) The curvature Ksym of nuclear symmetry energy at ρ0 from 16 new analyses of neutron star observables was about Ksym≈−107±88 MeV at a 68% confidence level, in very good agreement with the systematics of earlier analyses. (3) The magnitude of nuclear symmetry energy at 2ρ0, i.e., Esym(2ρ0)≈51±13 MeV at a 68% confidence level, was extracted from nine new analyses of neutron star observables, consistent with the results from earlier analyses of heavy-ion reactions and the latest predictions of the state-of-the-art nuclear many-body theories. (4) While the available data from canonical neutron stars did not provide tight constraints on nuclear symmetry energy at densities above about 2ρ0, the lower radius boundary R2.01=12.2 km from NICER’s very recent observation of PSR J0740+6620 of mass 2.08±0.07M⊙ and radius R=12.2–16.3 km at a 68% confidence level set a tight lower limit for nuclear symmetry energy at densities above 2ρ0. (5) Bayesian inferences of nuclear symmetry energy using models encapsulating a first-order hadron–quark phase transition from observables of canonical neutron stars indicated that the phase transition shifted appreciably both L and Ksym to higher values, but with larger uncertainties compared to analyses assuming no such phase transition. (6) The high-density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy significantly affected the minimum frequency necessary to rotationally support GW190814’s secondary component of mass (2.50–2.67) M⊙ as the fastest and most massive pulsar discovered so far. Overall, thanks to the hard work of many people in the astrophysics and nuclear physics community, new data of neutron star observations since the discovery of GW170817 have significantly enriched our knowledge about the symmetry energy of dense neutron-rich nuclear matter.},

abstract = {The ultimate goal of studying isospin physics via heavy-ion reactions with neutron-rich, stable and/or radioactive nuclei is to explore the isospin dependence of in-medium nuclear effective interactions and the equation of state of neutron-rich nuclear matter, particularly the isospin-dependent term in the equation of state, i.e., the density dependence of the symmetry energy. Because of its great importance for understanding many phenomena in both nuclear physics and astrophysics, the study of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy has been the main focus of the intermediate-energy heavy-ion physics community during the last decade, and significant progress has been achieved both experimentally and theoretically. In particular, a number of phenomena or observables have been identified as sensitive probes to the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy. Experimental studies have confirmed some of these interesting isospin-dependent effects and allowed us to constrain relatively stringently the symmetry energy at sub-saturation densities. The impact of this constrained density dependence of the symmetry energy on the properties of neutron stars have also been studied, and they were found to be very useful for the astrophysical community. With new opportunities provided by the various radioactive beam facilities being constructed around the world, the study of isospin physics is expected to remain one of the forefront research areas in nuclear physics. In this report, we review the major progress achieved during the last decade in isospin physics with heavy ion reactions and discuss future challenges to the most important issues in this field.}

In terms of sensitivity and cleanness, the breakup reactions induced by the polarized deuteron beam at about 100 MeV/u provide a more stringent constraint to the symmetry energy at subsaturation densities.},

The latter determines uniquely the neutron–proton effective k-mass splitting mn−p⁎(ρ,δ)≡(mn⁎−mp⁎)/m in neutron-rich nucleonic matter of isospin asymmetry δ. Using currently available constraints on the Esym(ρ0) and L(ρ0) at normal density ρ0 of nuclear matter from 28 recent analyses of various terrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations, we try to infer the corresponding neutron–proton effective k-mass splitting mn−p⁎(ρ0,δ). While the mean values of the mn−p⁎(ρ0,δ) obtained from most of the studies are remarkably consistent with each other and scatter very closely around an empirical value of mn−p⁎(ρ0,δ)=0.27⋅δ, it is currently not possible to scientifically state surely that the mn−p⁎(ρ0,δ) is positive within the present knowledge of the uncertainties. Quantifying, better understanding and then further reducing the uncertainties using modern statistical and computational techniques in extracting the Esym(ρ0) and L(ρ0) from analyzing the experimental data are much needed.}

We consider mainly particles with spin ½ and with spin 1; to a minor extent higher spins are included. The state of the art with respect to the production of polarized beams and targets and with respect to polarization analysing devices is briefly reviewed. A considerable amount of space is devoted to the definitions of cartesian polarization transfer and spin correlation coefficients which are suitable for the description of reactions involving spin ½ and spin 1 particles. These parameters are generalizations of the triple scattering and spin correlation parameters introduced by Wolfenstein for a description of nucleon-nucleon scattering. Finally, the experiments of these types so far performed are reviewed. Reactions involving photons are excluded, and the nucleon-nucleon problem is only briefly mentioned.

This review was completed in March 1972.}

abstract = {Nuclear collisions can compress nuclear matter to densities achieved within neutron stars and within core-collapse supernovae. These dense states of matter exist momentarily before expanding. We analyzed the flow of matter to extract pressures in excess of 1034 pascals, the highest recorded under laboratory-controlled conditions. Using these analyses, we rule out strongly repulsive nuclear equations of state from relativistic mean field theory and weakly repulsive equations of state with phase transitions at densities less than three times that of stable nuclei, but not equations of state softened at higher densities because of a transformation to quark matter.}}

abstract = {The intensity interferometry is applied as a chronometer of the particle emission of hydrogen isotopes from the intermediate velocity source formed in 40Ar+197Au reactions at 30 MeV/u. The dynamic emission order of τp>τd>τt is evidenced via the correlation functions of nonidentical particle pairs. Assuming the similar source size, the same emission order is inferred from the correlation functions of identical particle pairs, where τp≈100fm/c is extracted by the fit of Koonin-Pratt equation to p-p correlation function. Transport model simulations demonstrate that the dynamic emission order of light charged particles depends on the stiffness of the nuclear symmetry energy.}

abstract = {Synopsis
This paper investigates single particle properties in a Fermi gas with interaction at the absolute zero of temperature. In such a system a single particle energy has only a meaning for particles of momentum ‖k‖ close to the Fermi momentum kF. These single particle states are metastable with a life-time approaching infinity in the limit ‖k‖ → kF. The limiting value of the energy is called the Fermi energy EF. As a special case of a more general theorem, it is shown that for a system with zero pressure (i.e. a Fermi liquid at absolute zero) the Fermi energy EF is equal to the average energy per particle E0/N of the system. This result should apply both to liquid He3 and to nuclear matter. The theorem is used as a test on the internal consistency of the theory of Brueckner 1) for the structure of nuclear matter. It is seen that the large discrepancy between the values of EF and E0/N, as calculated by Brueckner and Gammel 2), arises from the fact that Brueckner neglects important cluster terms contributing to the single particle energy. This neglection strongly affects the calculation of the optical potential.}
